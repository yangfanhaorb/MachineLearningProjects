# MachineLearningProjects
The machine learning projects that I did for the Machine Learning class on Coursera  
They include:  
* Linear regression with multiple variables
* Regularization
* Neural Networks: Representation
* Advice for applying machine learning
* Support vector machine
* K-means Clustering
* Principal Component Analysis
* Anomaly Detection
* Recommender Systems

The base code was supplied by the course instructor and my task was to add code that implemented the corresponding machine
learning functions.
